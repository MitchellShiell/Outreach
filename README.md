# Welcome to our Outreach Repo!

Our organization is dedicated to positively impacting our community and beyond. We believe that by working together, we can achieve great things and make a difference in the lives of those around us. At Overture, we recognize the importance of data and strive to connect data to the minds of those advancing the knowledge and treatment of cancer. Our mission is to develop and distribute cutting-edge software that empowers researchers to make meaningful discoveries.

The role of Outreach is to maximize the promotion and dissemination of Overtures mission, programs, and services to key stakeholders through all forms of communication.
